The Graphic Design Application provides users the ability to interact with graphical shapes. With this application, users can easily create, manipulate, and analyze a variety of shapes. Additionally, the program includes functionality for saving and loading shapes from files, along with other useful features to enhance the user experience. These include Undo and Redo buttons, functions for computing the area of specific shapes, options for selecting, copying, moving, pasting, deleting, and changing the color of already drawn shapes. Additionally, users can export the drawn shapes in various formats such as txt, json, xml or jpeg.

## Drawing Shapes

To draw a shape, simply choose the desired shape from the available buttons. Next, select the outline and fill color from the menu. Then, left-click on the canvas and drag the mouse to increase the size of the shape. Finally, left-click again to finalize the drawing. **_(üéûVideo: 00:00-00:50)_**

## Selecting Shapes

To select one or more shapes, double-click within their boundaries. You'll notice that a shape is selected when its outline becomes dashed.

## Manipulating Shapes

Once you've selected one or more shapes, you can access manipulation options by right-clicking. These options allow you to perform various actions on the selected figures, such as:

- Move (for one or several selected shapes)
  
  To relocate the selected shapes, right-click and choose the "Move" option from the drop-down menu. Once positioned, click the left mouse button to confirm their placement.
  
- Copy (for one or several selected shapes)
  
  To copy the selected shapes, right-click and choose the "Copy" option from the drop-down menu.
  
- Paste (for one or several selected shapes)

  If you've already copied one or several shapes, you can paste them by right-clicking at the desired location and selecting the "Paste" option from the drop-down menu.
  
- Delete (for one or several selected shapes)

  To delete the selected shapes, right-click and choose the "Delete" option from the drop-down menu.
  
- Change border color (only for a single selected shap–µ)

  To change the border color of the selected shape, right-click and choose the "Change border color" option from the drop-down menu. Next, select the desired color from the provided color palette window and click OK to confirm.
  
- Change fill color (only for a single selected shape)

  To change the fill color of the selected shape, right-click and choose the "Change fill color" option from the drop-down menu. Next, select the desired color from the provided color palette window and click OK to confirm.

## Finding Shapes' Area

To determine the area of a selected shape, simply press the "Calculate Area" button. The area of the shape, measured in millimeters, along with its type, will be displayed in the field next to the button.

By choosing "Area" from the menu located at the top of the window, you can access various useful functions. These include finding the common face of all shapes, determining the shape with the smallest and largest area among all shapes or among shapes of a specified type.

## Undo and Redo Operations

By choosing the "Undo" and "Redo" options from the menu located at the top of the window you can undo or redo the actions/manipulations done with the shapes

## Saving and Loading Shapes

To save your drawn figures for future editing, follow these steps: 
- select "File" from the menu at the top of the window
- choose the option "Save" from the drop-down menu
-  save the file containing the figures to your desired location, and assign it a name.

## Exporting Shapes

To export the shapes, navigate to "File" -> "Export" -> check the checkbox corresponding to the desired format. The parameters of the shapes can be exported in txt, json, or xml formats, while the canvas on which we have drawn can be saved as a jpeg file.
